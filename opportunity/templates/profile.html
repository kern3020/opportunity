	<h1>Profile - skills the job seeker has on offer.</h1>

	<p> 
	On the job hunt, you often tell stories. This page is design to help you organize your elevator pitch and response to behavior interview questions. 
	</p>

	<p> When you meet a new person on the job hunt, the elevator pitch allows you to convey your value proposition. </p>

	<p> During the interview process in the United States, the job candidate is often asked a series of behavior question. 
		<ul>
			<li>Tell me about how you worked effectively under pressure.</li>
			<li>How do you handle a challenge? Give an example.</li>
			<li>Have you ever made a mistake? How did you handle it? </li>
		</ul>

	The PAR format is a good way to answer these questions. PAR stands for problem, action and results. Consider the queston about overcoming a challenge. You'd need to tell the interviewer about a specific <b>problem</b> in your career where you faced a challenge. Outline the <b>actions</b> you told to overcome it. Finally, you should talk about <b>results</b>.
